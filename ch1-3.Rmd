##Ch1

The predictability of an event or a quantity depends on several factors including:

how well we understand the factors that contribute to it;
how much data is available;
how similar the future is to the past;
whether the forecasts can affect the thing we are trying to forecast.


##Ch2

```{r}

y <- tsibble(
  Year = 2015:2019,
  Observation = c(123, 39, 78, 52, 110),
  index = Year
)

y

```

```{r}

#saving A10 so that we can use it for the rest of the chapter

PBS %>%
  filter(ATC2 == "A10") %>%
  select(Month, Concession, Type, Cost) %>%
  summarise(TotalC = sum(Cost)) %>%
  mutate(Cost = TotalC / 1e6) -> a10
```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
